Poly Network has released Poly Bridge version 2.0 recently, significantly optimizing the interface and improving the functionality of version 1.0. 
This user manual serves as a guide for transacting NFTs on the brand new Poly Bridge 2.0.

> [!Note|style:flat|label:Notice]
> To enter the Poly Bridge 2.0 interface, please click [PolyBridge](https://bridge.poly.network/nft) and go to the NFT transaction page. 
> As an example, this manual uses the NFT transaction between BNB chain and Polygon. 

A successful cross-chain transaction requires the completion of the following 6 steps.


### Step1. Wallet and network connection
Find the button “Connect Wallet” in the top right corner of this page and connect your wallet to the source chain from which you want to transfer NFT. Make sure the network of your wallet stays consistent with that of the source chain you selected. In this example, we have selected BNB Chain as source chain, as shown in the figure:

### Step2. Transaction information selection
Select the transaction information, including source chain (in From), the NFT asset you want to transfer (in Collection), the NFT item you want to transfer (in Item) and target chain (in To).

> The transaction will fail to process if the network of your wallet is inconsistent with that of the source chain. 
> Additionally, make sure you indeed own the NFT collection you select or the transaction will not be processed.


### Step3. Target chain wallet connection
After filling out the transaction information, click “Connect Wallet” below, and then click on the target chain wallet to which you want to transfer NFT.
