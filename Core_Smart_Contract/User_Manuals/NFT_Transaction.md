### Step1. Wallet and network connection
Find the button “Connect Wallet” in the top right corner of this page and connect your wallet to the source chain from which you want to transfer NFT. Make sure the network of your wallet stays consistent with that of the source chain you selected. In this example, we have selected BNB Chain as source chain, as shown in the figure:

> The transaction will fail to process if the network of your wallet is inconsistent with that of the source chain. 
> Additionally, make sure you indeed own the NFT collection you select or the transaction will not be processed.


### Step3. Target chain wallet connection
After filling out the transaction information, click “Connect Wallet” below, and then click on the target chain wallet to which you want to transfer NFT.
