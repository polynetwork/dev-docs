<h1 align="center">Develop for Customized Contracts</h1>

Business logic contracts can be customized according to your cross-chain requirements, but the following three important logics must be fulfilled to ensure cross-chain functionality in Poly Network ecosystem.


### Step1. Mapping relationship

Business contracts need to maintain two mapping relationships between chains, one is **asset mapping relationship**, and the other is **business logic contract mapping relationship**.

#### Example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "./../../libs/ownership/Ownable.sol";

contract LockProxy is Ownable {
    address public managerProxyContract;
    mapping(uint64 => bytes) public proxyHashMap;
    mapping(address => mapping(uint64 => bytes)) public assetHashMap;
    
    // toChainId: the target chain id
    // targetProxyHash: the address of business logic contract on target chain
    function bindProxyHash(uint64 toChainId, bytes memory targetProxyHash) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {
        proxyHashMap[toChainId] = targetProxyHash;
        emit BindProxyEvent(toChainId, targetProxyHash);
        return true;
    }
    
    // fromAssetHash: asset hash on source chain 
    // toAssetHash: asset hash on target chain
    function bindAssetHash(address fromAssetHash, uint64 toChainId, bytes memory toAssetHash) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {
        assetHashMap[fromAssetHash][toChainId] = toAssetHash;
        emit BindAssetEvent(fromAssetHash, toChainId, toAssetHash, getBalanceFor(fromAssetHash));
        return true;
    }
}
```
- The `assetHashMap` is a mapping structure used to store the asset mapping relationship between chains. It takes the source asset hash (`fromAssetHash`) and the target chain ID (`toChainId`) as the key, and the target asset hash (`toAssetHash`) as the value. The function `bindAssetHash` is used to write this relationship in the contract store.
- The `proxyHashMap` is a mapping structure used to store the business logic contract mapping relationship between chains, which helps the [CCM contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManager.sol) to find the correct contract on the target chain. It takes the target chain ID (`toChainId`) as the key, and the target business logic contract hash (`targetProxyHash`) as the value. And the function `bindProxyHash` is used to write this relationship in the contract store.

### Step2. Initiating transaction on source chain

A method is required to invoke the `crossChain` function in the CCM, i.e., to initiate a cross-chain transaction. The source code of `crossChain` is [here](https://dev-docs.poly.network/new_chain/side_chain/contracts.html#step3-pushing-transactions).


```solidity
/*  
 *  @param toChainId              The target chain id
 *  @param toAddress              The address in bytes format to receive the same amount of tokens in the target chain
 *  @param toContract             Target smart contract address in bytes in the target blockchain
 *  @param txData                 Transaction data for target chain, include toAssetHash, toAddress, amount
 *  @return                       true or false 
*/
function crossChain (uint64 toChainId, bytes calldata toContract, bytes calldata method, bytes calldata txData) whenNotPaused external returns (bool);
```

#### Example:

```solidity
/*  
 *  @param fromAssetHash     The asset address in the current chain
 *  @param toChainId         The target chain id
 *  @param toAddress         The address in bytes format to receive the same amount of tokens in the target chain 
 *  @param amount            The number of tokens to be crossed from Ethereum to the chain with chainId
*/
function lock(address fromAssetHash, uint64 toChainId, bytes memory toAddress, uint256 amount) public payable returns (bool) {
    require(amount != 0, "amount cannot be zero!");
    require(_transferToContract(fromAssetHash, amount), "transfer asset from fromAddress to lock_proxy contract failed!");
        
    bytes memory toAssetHash = assetHashMap[fromAssetHash][toChainId];
    require(toAssetHash.length != 0, "empty illegal toAssetHash");

    TxArgs memory txArgs = TxArgs({
        toAssetHash: toAssetHash,
        toAddress: toAddress,
        amount: amount
    });
    bytes memory txData = _serializeTxArgs(txArgs);
        
    IEthCrossChainManagerProxy eccmp = IEthCrossChainManagerProxy(managerProxyContract);
    address eccmAddr = eccmp.getEthCrossChainManager();
    IEthCrossChainManager eccm = IEthCrossChainManager(eccmAddr);
        
    bytes memory toProxyHash = proxyHashMap[toChainId];
    require(toProxyHash.length != 0, "empty illegal toProxyHash");
    require(eccm.crossChain(toChainId, toProxyHash, "unlock", txData), "EthCrossChainManager crossChain executed error!");

    emit LockEvent(fromAssetHash, _msgSender(), toChainId, toAssetHash, toAddress, amount);
        
    return true;
    
}
```
- The function `lock` is used to invoke the function `crossChain` in [CCM contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManager.sol), whose parameters include `toChainId`, `toContract`, `method` and `txData`.  The `toChainId`, `toContract` meant the chain ID and the business logic contract on the target chain. The `method` is the function called on the target chain. Besides, the `lock` also needs to pack the transaction data, like  `toAssetHash`, `toAddress`, `amount`, into `txData`, so that the target chain method（mentioned `unlock`） can deserialize it.
- By calling this method, the business logic contract will **lock** a certain amount of valuable assets. And a `CrossChainEvent` will be emitted in [CCM contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManager.sol) in order to be catched by relayer to complete the remaining processes.
- The `LockEvent` is necessary for concatenation between source trasactions and target transactions.


### Step3. Executing on target chain

A method is required to parse and execute the transaction information transferred by `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx` in [CCM contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManager.sol). 
The `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx` function verifies the **legality** of the cross-chain transaction information, and passes the parsed transaction data from Poly chain to the business logic contract. 
The source code of `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx` is [here](https://dev-docs.poly.network/new_chain/side_chain/contracts.html#step4-Verifying & executing).

````solidity
/*  
 *  @param proof                  Poly chain transaction Merkle proof
 *  @param rawHeader              The header containing crossStateRoot to verify the above tx Merkle proof
 *  @param headerProof            The header Merkle proof used to verify rawHeader
 *  @param curRawHeader           Any header in current epoch consensus of Poly chain
 *  @param headerSig              The converted signature variable for solidity derived from Poly chain consensus nodes' signature 
 *                                used to verify the validity of curRawHeader
 *  @return                       true or false
*/
function verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx (bytes memory proof, bytes memory rawHeader, bytes memory headerProof, bytes memory curRawHeader, bytes memory headerSig) whenNotPaused public returns (bool);
````

- The customized method should be conformed to the format called by `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx`, as shown in follows:

```solidity
 // The returnData will be bytes32, the last byte must be 01;
(success, returnData) = _toContract.call(abi.encodePacked(bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_method, "(bytes,bytes,uint64)"))), abi.encode(_args, _fromContractAddr, _fromChainId)))

```

#### Example:

```solidity
/*  
 *  @param argsBs            The argument bytes received by the lock proxy contract on source chain, 
 *                           need to be deserialized based on the way of serialization in the 
 *                           lock proxy contract on source chain.
 *  @param fromContractAddr  The source chain contract address
 *  @param fromChainId       The source chain id
*/
function unlock(bytes memory argsBs, bytes memory fromContractAddr, uint64 fromChainId) onlyManagerContract public returns (bool) {
    TxArgs memory args = _deserializeTxArgs(argsBs);
    require(fromContractAddr.length != 0, "from proxy contract address cannot be empty");
    require(Utils.equalStorage(proxyHashMap[fromChainId], fromContractAddr), "From Proxy contract address error!");
        
    require(args.toAssetHash.length != 0, "toAssetHash cannot be empty");
    address toAssetHash = Utils.bytesToAddress(args.toAssetHash);

    require(args.toAddress.length != 0, "toAddress cannot be empty");
    address toAddress = Utils.bytesToAddress(args.toAddress);

    require(_transferFromContract(toAssetHash, toAddress, args.amount), "transfer asset from lock_proxy contract to toAddress failed!");
        
    emit UnlockEvent(toAssetHash, toAddress, args.amount);
    return true;
}
```

- The mapping relationship of business logic contracts needs to be checked in `proxyHashMap`.
- The function `unlock` is used to deserialize and execute the transaction data `argsBs`, i.e., to transfer a certain amount of token to the target address on the target chain.
- For safety, the function `unlock` only can be called by the [CCM contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManager.sol). In this case, the modifier `onlyManagerContract` restricts the calling authority by obtaining the CCM contract address of CCM in CCMP contract. While the function `setManagerProxy` is used to set the [CCMP contract](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/interface/IEthCrossChainManagerProxy.sol) address, as shown in follows:

```solidity
    modifier onlyManagerContract() {
        IEthCrossChainManagerProxy ieccmp = IEthCrossChainManagerProxy(managerProxyContract);
        require(_msgSender() == ieccmp.getEthCrossChainManager(), "msgSender is not EthCrossChainManagerContract");
        _;
    }
    
    function setManagerProxy(address ethCCMProxyAddr) onlyOwner public {
        managerProxyContract = ethCCMProxyAddr;
        emit SetManagerProxyEvent(managerProxyContract);
    }
```
