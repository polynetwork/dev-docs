<h1 align="center">Develop for Poly Chain</h1>


This step shows you how Poly Chain verifies cross-chain transactions from your chain. 
Verification by synchronizing block headers is the most common method.
The tutorial below will describe how to implement this method in detail.

> [!Note|style:flat|label:Notice]
> If your chain **doesn't** support the method of verification by synchronizing block headers (i.e., your chain fails to meet the prerequisites listed),
> here are also other solutions,
> and please contact `Poly team` via <a class="fab fa-discord" href= "https://discord.com/invite/y6MuEnq"></a> for more support.

## 1. Prerequisites

There are three prerequisites to verify by synchronizing block headers.

- Your chain must support light client verification, like Simple Payment Verification (SPV) protocol in Bitcoin or Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES) in Ethereum, which means the block header must contain the following informationï¼š

  - Hash of the previous block header.
  - Hash of the Merkle state root.
  - A way to prove the unique legitimacy of a block.
  
- Make sure block header struct in your chain can be parsed and verified correctly.

- Make sure the Merkle state root in your chain can be parsed and verified correctly.


## 2. Development Specifications

There are four steps to be implemented for the verification method. 

### Step1. Adding a router for your chain

When importing your chain to Poly Chain, the first thing you need to do is to add a router for your chain in the [file](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/utils/params.go#L43). 

### Step2 Implementing the interface of block header synchronization

- First, corresponding handler should be added in the [file](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/header_sync/entrance.go#L62).
- Second, implement the method for the interface of HeaderSyncHandler, as shown in follows:

```go
type HeaderSyncHandler interface {
	SyncGenesisHeader(service *native.NativeService) error
	SyncBlockHeader(service *native.NativeService) error
	SyncCrossChainMsg(service *native.NativeService) error
}
```

| Method                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SyncGenesisHeader**   | This method is used to store the initial block header so that the subsequent block headers of blocks that contain cross-chain events can be verified and synchronized. This method will only be called for **once** in initializing the new chain. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/native/service/header_sync/eth/header_sync.go#L61) for more details. |
| **SyncBlockHeader**     | This method is used to synchronize block headers consistently from the new chain to Poly Chain. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/native/service/header_sync/eth/header_sync.go#L99) for more details.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **SyncCrossChainMsg**   | This method is used to fetch cross chain message. Please refer to the ontology [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/header_sync/ont/header_sync.go#L106) or eth [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/header_sync/eth/header_sync.go#L216) for more details.  |


### Step3. Implementing the interface of cross chain management

- First, corresponding handler is needed to be add in the [file](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/cross_chain_manager/entrance.go#L61).
- Second, implement the method for the interface of ChainHandler, as shown in follows:

```go
type ChainHandler interface {
	MakeDepositProposal(service *native.NativeService) (*MakeTxParam, error)
}
```

| Method                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MakeDepositProposal** | This method is used to verify the legitimacy of cross-chain transactions and store legitimate transactions to Poly Chain. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/native/service/cross_chain_manager/eth/eth_handler.go#L34) for more details. |

The return struct [**MakeTxParam**](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/1e629995982e61930e962e84606998f15233c534/native/service/cross_chain_manager/common/param.go#L148) is used for subsequent notification that the transaction has been verified. 

```go
type MakeTxParam struct {
	TxHash              []byte
	CrossChainID        []byte
	FromContractAddress []byte
	ToChainID           uint64
	ToContractAddress   []byte
	Method              string
	Args                []byte
}
```

In the example of the function **MakeDepositProposal**, there are two functions (**verifyFromTx** and **verifyMerkleProof**) that play an important role in cross-chain verification.

|-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **verifyFromTx**  | This method is used to get the synchronized block header from the database stored in Poly Chain, and then to call the function **verifyMerkleProof** to verify the legitimacy of cross-chain transaction, and decode the [Extra data](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/ea51f848c3b4284c046ca9bab527869846679640/native/service/cross_chain_manager/common/param.go#L68) to construct MakeTxParam. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/4323af5cfcd2a3277653d5bdc4db015cd9755fee/native/service/cross_chain_manager/eth/utils.go#L41) for more details. |

```

### Step4. Developing for register tool

The final step to import your chain is to register your chain in Poly Chain and synchronize zion genesis header to your chain. 
There are two methods required, as shown in follows:

| Method                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RegisterSideChain**     | This method is used to register your chain in Poly Chain. Please refer to the code for more details.. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly-io-test/blob/035b7fadee297e6e1b5a0b3dcde80f22442d8fb1/cmd/tools/run.go#L1765) for more details. |
| **SyncPolyGenesisHeader** | This method is used to achieve two-way synchronization of genesis block headers between Poly Chain and your chain. Please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly-io-test/blob/master/cmd/tools/run.go#L607) for more details.                      |

Now, the development for Poly Chain is completed.
