## Relayer

A relayer is a cross-chain information porter that performs some of the most critical cross-chain operations. It acts as the medium of interaction between the side chain and the outside world.

Each chain in the cross-chain ecosystem has a relayer associated with it. A relayer monitors its corresponding chain network for cross-chain transactions and forwards detected block headers to the Poly chain, motivated by incentives which it receives in the process.
Simultaenously, a relayer monitors cross-chain transactions taking place on the Poly chain and transfers them to the respective side chain.


## Source Chain

A public chain corresponding to the chain on which a particular asset first appears.

For example, Ethereum is the source chain of the Ether asset.

## Target Chain

A public chain corresponding to the recipient chain of a cross chain transaction, where a new token is issued.

For example, Ethereum is the source chain of the Ether asset.
When we want to issue a new OEP4 token in the Ontology network that represents the Ether, the Ontology chain bceomes the target chain.

And vice versa, for the ONT token, the Ontology chain is the source chain.
When we want to issue a new ERC20 token in the Ethereum chain, Ethereum becomes the target chain for the Ont network.

## Poly Chain

The relay chain in the cross-chain ecosystem, a crucial component of the cross-chain ecosystem. The various types of nodes are deployed and maintained by other individuals or organizations and have their own unique governance and trust mechanism. The Poly chain is responsible for connecting them, standardizing cross-chain data flow, interfaces, and verifying the legitimacy of cross-chain data, etc.

## Canonical Block

A block is included in the primary blockchain and is directly or indirectly refered to by future blocks. Blocks that are not canonical may have been valid but were discarded in favor of the canonical block.

##  Cross Chain Council

A Council formed by poly consensus nodes.

## Total Volume

The total volume of transaction processed in Poly, accounting both inflows and outflows.

## Total Volume Locked 

Total volume locked is a figure that represents the spot value (usually in fiat terms i.e. USD) for all the assets that are currently staked in a specific protocol on Poly.

## Total Inbound Assets

The total volume of assets transferred into this chain.
